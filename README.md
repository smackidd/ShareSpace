# ShareSpace
Web Fundamentals Course fictional website for sharing office spaces AirBnb style.

This is a fully functioning Front-end and Back-end website. Launch the server with "node index.js" and type in the URL in any browser: 
"http://localhost:3030/"

The Back-end was adapted from code built during the Front-end phase. During coding of the Front-end the data was all pushed to an array of multiple objects and then stored in localStorage. While applying the Back-end, to avoid changing much of the JavaScript code, everytime the user makes a change to the data, I forced the array to a hidden Input tag value and POSTed the value of that Input tag to my api and then saved the data to my filesystem. 

This approach makes the website functional but is not coded in the way a traditional full stack application would be. The next step will be to apply an HTML template and a Database.
